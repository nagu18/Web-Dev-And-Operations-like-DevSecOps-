# About Me & Skills

My skills include Python, Django, Docker, Helm, Kubernetes, MicroK8s, CI/CD, PostgreSQL, cybersecurity, SOC, CCNA, and pentesting, focusing on integrating development and operations practices to enhance security and efficiency. I developed the Django app (Code-Valit).

# Overview

This guide provides steps to deploy a Django application using Helm on a Kubernetes cluster, emphasizing secure and streamlined operations.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the Django app using Helm, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Kubernetes cluster up and running (MicroK8s recommended)
- Helm installed (version 3 or later)
- kubectl configured to connect to your Kubernetes cluster

## Installing Helm

If Helm is not installed, follow these steps:

For macOS (using Homebrew):
```bash
brew install helm
```

For Linux:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

For Windows (using Chocolatey):
```powershell
choco install kubernetes-helm
```

Verify Helm installation:
```bash
helm version
```

## Deploying the Django App

Run the following command to install the Django app using Helm:

```bash
helm install django-app
```

## Security Features

This deployment approach integrates robust security practices, leveraging Kubernetes' native capabilities and Helm's configuration management to ensure a secure and compliant application environment.
